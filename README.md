# Xeerio - Namechecker
> Original website: [xeerio.com](https://www.xeerio.com)    

Check the **availability of your idea**, upcoming product or company in terms of **domain names**, **social media**, **trademarks** and check the strength and originality of your name in mind.

## Intro
Xeerio is an innovative web app written in **Nextjs** to boost your productivity and inspiration. The underlying backend uses [WHOIS lookups](https://www.whois.com/whois/) in order to check the availability of the most wanted domain extensions (including the customer’s local domain - IP address won’t be saved on the server). Using advanced web scraping techniques it also searches today's most popular social media networks for the username you have in mind.

## A web app designed for your privacy
We refuse to use any third-party implementations that might invade our customers’ privacy. Everything you do on the website is **anonymously** logged and won’t be shared with anyone/anything.

This web app doesn’t make use of **coockies** and none of your information is been stored or captured.
